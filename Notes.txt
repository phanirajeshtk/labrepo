    What is Kubernetes and why we need it?
      Kubernetes is the operating system of the cloud
      Kubernetes is the bunch of virtual machines who communicate properly with each other and do divide their workload
     control plane 
        worker nodes
          
    YAML File - Specify Hey, Kubernetes I want 3 replicas of this image
        Kubernetes Control plane then creates containers in the available worked nodes or create additional worker nodes and create replicas based on the demand
        
    What are pods?
        A pod is the smallest element on  a kuberntes cluster
        Pod of whales
        A pod not a container!
        A pod is a collection of containers + other resources

        Single container - Networking
        Multi container - Storage
